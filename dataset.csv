its ok+1
They look good and stick good! I just don't like the rounded shape because I was always bumping it and Siri kept popping up and it was irritating. I just won't buy a product like this again+-1		
These stickers work like the review says they do. They stick on great and they stay on the phone. They are super stylish and I can share them with my sister. :)+1
These are awesome and make my phone look so stylish! I have only used one so far and have had it on for almost a year! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT! ONE YEAR!! Great quality!+1
Item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition. However	 I ordered these buttons because they were a great deal and included a FREE screen protector. I never received one. Though its not a big deal	 it would've been nice to get it since they claim it comes with one.+1
awesome! stays on	 and looks great. can be used on multiple apple products.  especially having nails	 it helps to have an elevated key.+1
These make using the home button easy. My daughter and I both like them.  I would purchase them again. Well worth the price.+1
Came just as described.. It doesn't come unstuck and its cute! People ask where I got them from & it's great when driving.+1
